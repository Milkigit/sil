- probably rename rb3_head to rb3_node
- revise find/insert/delete API. Probably something like:
    struct rb3_head *rb3_find(struct rb3_tree *, rb3_datacmp, void *);
    // is this needed at all?
    struct rb3_head *rb3_find_insertion_point(struct rb3_tree *, rb3_datacmp, void *, struct rb3_head **, int *);
    //
    struct rb3_head *rb3_find_insert(struct rb3_tree *, struct rb3_head *, rb3_datacmp, void *);
    struct rb3_head *rb3_unlink(struct rb3_head *);
    // Probably we also want
    int rb3_is_linked(struct rb3_head *);
