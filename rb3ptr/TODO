- maybe rename rb3_head to rb3_node or rb3_link
- work out which of the navigation functions take NULL
- Support fixing up links after reallocation of backing memory. How? For single
  contiguous backing array, we could add an offset to all child or parent
  pointers. For non-contiguous?  More difficult. We probably want a toolbox
  approach.
- for Multimaps:
   - recommend including memory address in comparison function? What about
     reallocation?
   - want something like rb3_find_first() / rb3_find_last() for predicates that
     satisfy a range of items (but must still be monotonic with respect to tree
     ordering).
