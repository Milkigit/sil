rb3ptr is a 3-pointer Red-black tree implementation that focuses on all of:
efficiency (time, space and also code-size), type safety, ease of use.

It aims for C99 compatibility. It uses a few C99 features but currently seems
to compile with -std=gnu89 as well. (Not: -std=c89 since we use "inline")

Type safety is provided by macros that wrap the generic code. The wrapper's
machine code size comes mostly from inlined comparison functions (inlining the
comparison functions will soon be optional).

rb3ptr has no external dependencies. It's not even dependent on the C standard
library.

Building the source
===================

The C source must be generated by calling build.sh (requires python3). build.sh
produces build/include/rb3ptr.h, which is the file you want to include in your
projects, from the files under templates/.

RB3_GEN_IMPL() alternative: Additionally to rb3ptr.h, the generic
implementation is generated as the standalone files rb3ptr-impl.c and
rb3ptr-impl.h. Compiling the implementation separately has the disadvantage of
having to drop multiple files into one's project, but the advantage of not
needing the RB3_GEN_IMPL() macro which is a pain for debugging.

To test the build you can then run build-examples.sh.

Instead of building rb3ptr.h you can also use the prebuilt version in
prebuilt/. Check the git commit hash to make sure that it's a recent version.

Documentation
=============

Currently the best documentation is the example programs under examples/. Or
just look at the source or generated header file. The user-facing API has some
comments.
